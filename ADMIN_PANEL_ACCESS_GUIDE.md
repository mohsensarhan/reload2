## 🔐 How to Access the Admin Panel

### Step 1: Create an Admin User

Before you can access the admin panel, you need to create an admin user in your Supabase database.

#### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/oktiojqphavkqeirbbul
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Users**
3. Click **Add User** (or **Invite User**)
4. Create a user with:
   - Email: `admin@example.com` (or your preferred email)
   - Password: Your secure password
5. After creating the user, go to **Table Editor** → **users** table
6. Find the user you just created
7. Set the `role` field to `admin`

#### Option B: Using SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/oktiojqphavkqeirbbul
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Run this SQL query (replace with your actual user ID):

```sql
-- First, create the auth user (if not already created)
-- You'll need to do this through the Supabase Auth UI first

-- Then, insert or update the user in the users table
INSERT INTO users (id, email, role, created_at)
VALUES (
  'YOUR_USER_ID_FROM_AUTH',  -- Get this from auth.users table
  'admin@example.com',
  'admin',
  NOW()
)
ON CONFLICT (id) 
DO UPDATE SET role = 'admin';
```

### Step 2: Login to the Admin Panel

1. Visit: https://reload2.vercel.app/login
2. Enter your admin credentials:
   - Email: `admin@example.com` (or the email you created)
   - Password: Your password
3. After successful login, navigate to: https://reload2.vercel.app/admin

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### Problem
The `/admin` route was returning a **404 NOT_FOUND** error from Vercel because there was no routing configuration for the Single Page Application (SPA).

### Solution
Added `vercel.json` configuration file with SPA routing rules:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This tells Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

### Changes Made
1. ✅ Created `vercel.json` with SPA routing configuration
2. ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub
3. ✅ Deployed new version to Vercel
4. ✅ Verified `/admin` route now loads properly

# Should return: HTTP/2 200 (not 404)
```

### Test 2: Check Authentication
1. Visit https://reload2.vercel.app/admin without logging in
2. Should redirect to `/login` page

### Test 3: Check Admin Access
1. Login with a non-admin user
2. Try to access `/admin`
3. Should see "Access Denied" message

### Test 4: Full Admin Access
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. Should see full admin panel with all features

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Access Denied" when accessing /admin

**Solution:** Make sure your user has the `admin` role in the `users` table:

```sql
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Issue: Redirected to /login

**Solution:** You need to login first. The admin panel requires authentication.

### Issue: Black screen or errors

**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
3. Make sure Supabase connection is working

### Issue: Changes not saving

**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase RLS policies allow admin users to update data
2. Verify your user has the correct role
3. Check browser console for API errors
